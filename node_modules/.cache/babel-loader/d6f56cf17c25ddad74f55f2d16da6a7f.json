The primary goal of this website is to give\n              fishing enthusiasts an online platform where they can connect with\n              one another, share their best catches, and discover new fishing\n              spots.\n            </summary>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"vert-center\">\n          <div id=\"catch-img\" />\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <div className=\"cs-container\">\n        <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img src={Splash} alt=\"Splash Page Screenshot\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n            <header>Assignment</header>\n            <article>\n              During the later portion of my full-stack web development course\n              with App Academy, I was tasked with single-handedly creating a\n              full-stack web application, the purpose of which was my choosing.\n              Considering the prevalence of fishing-themed Facebook groups, and\n              the fact that I myself am an avid fly-fisher, I decided to create\n              a social media platform specifically for people who love to fish\n              (and talk about it).\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n            <header>Planning</header>\n            <article>\n              First and foremost, Fishhook had to provide a way for users to\n              find and connect with one another. Secondly, users needed to be\n              able to personalize their account and post content for their\n              Fishhook friends to see. Lastly, I planned to add functionality\n              that would allow users to share fishing spots with their friends\n              leveraging Google Maps API.\n            </article>\n\n            <article>\n              Before I started developing Fishhook, I sat down and sketched out\n              the backend architecture of my app, as well as all the frontend\n              views that it would include. I didn’t have much time for this\n              project, so after my pen-and-paper wireframes were complete, I\n              began developing.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bottom-margin-override\">\n            <header>Features and Functionality</header>\n            <article>\n              I implemented Fishhook using Ruby on Rails for the backend and\n              PostgreSQL for the database. This way, I could leverage Rails’s\n              convention-over-configuration philosophy for quick development,\n              and SQL to manage relationships between different entities in my\n              database, such as users, friend requests, and posts. I used\n              Postman to test my backend API before moving on.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              On the frontend, I leveraged Redux to manage application state,\n              and ReactJS to create a responsive user interface. I employed AJAX\n              to send asynchronous requests to my backend API.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              Users of Fishhook can search other users and friend-request them.\n              If you want to friend-request a user, you can do so by navigating\n              to their profile page and clicking the “Add Friend” button.\n              Incoming friend requests can be viewed in a dropdown modal. You\n              can accept an incoming friend request, or delete it.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-img-small-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n            <img\n              src={Search}\n              alt=\"Search Screenshot\"\n              className=\"cs-img-small\"\n            />\n            <img\n              src={Requests}\n              alt=\"Requests Modal Screenshot\"\n              className=\"cs-img-small\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bottom-margin-override\">\n            <article>\n              Once you’ve befriended a user, you can see their posts in the\n              “Feed” component of the app. You can also navigate to a user’s\n              profile page and see all the content that they have posted.\n              Similarly, you can view a user’s friends on their profile page by\n              clicking on the “Friends” tab.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-img-small-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n            <img\n              src={UserFeed}\n              alt=\"User Feed Screenshot\"\n              className=\"cs-img-small\"\n            />\n            <img\n              src={Friends}\n              alt=\"Friends Screenshot\"\n              className=\"cs-img-small\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img src={Feed} alt=\"Feed Screenshot\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n            <header>Challenges</header>\n            <article>\n              Developing Fishhook presented me with a variety of challenges as a\n              new developer. The first problem I ran into was how to create\n              “friend-requests” between users, that, when accepted, would\n              associate the users and allow them to see each other's content.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I got around this by creating a “requests” joins table using Ruby\n              on Rails ORM. The table had columns for the “requester_id”, the\n              “requested_id”, and a boolean status field indicating whether or\n              not the request had been accepted. Users create entries in this\n              table when they issue a friend request. Once the receiving user\n              accepts the request, the status field is updated, and the entry\n              becomes an association between the users.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I also ran into difficult bugs in this project, the most\n              frustrating of which was an error in one of my Redux reducers. I\n              had a JavaScript Object storing arrays. When I tried to copy this\n              object into the updated application state, I used Object.assign(),\n              which created a shallow copy, and preserved the object ids of the\n              arrays inside.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I spent hours searching for the cause of the unexpected behavior\n              that ensued. Finally, when logging my application state changes\n              with Chrome DevTools, I noticed that the contents of the arrays\n              from previous state changes retroactively updated with each new\n              state change. The “old arrays” would update to have the same\n              contents as the “new arrays”. This pointed me towards the source\n              of the problem, and taught me a valuable lesson about object\n              identity in JavaScript.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n            <header>Conclusion</header>\n            <article>\n              Fishhook was my first full-stack project at App Academy, and my\n              first real venture into software development. It’s important to\n              note that this project served as an educational experience for me.\n              Not everything about the app is production quality, and there are\n              still plenty of aspects for me to improve upon.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I plan to continue to work on Fishhook to improve the user\n              interface, make the layout more responsive to different device\n              sizes, and add the rest of the functionality that I included in\n              the blueprints. All things considered, Fishhook turned out to be\n              an excellent learning experience, and gave me a strong sense of\n              the fundamentals of web development.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Fishhook;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
