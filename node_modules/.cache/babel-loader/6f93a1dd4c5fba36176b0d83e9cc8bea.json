Once the receiving user\n              accepts the request, the status field is updated, and the entry\n              becomes an association between the users.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I also ran into difficult bugs in this project, the most\n              frustrating of which was an error in one of my Redux reducers. I\n              had a JavaScript Object storing arrays. When I tried to copy this\n              object into the updated application state, I used Object.assign(),\n              which created a shallow copy, and preserved the object ids of the\n              arrays inside.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I spent hours searching for the cause of the unexpected behavior\n              that ensued. Finally, when logging my application state changes\n              with Chrome DevTools, I noticed that the contents of the arrays\n              from previous state changes retroactively updated with each new\n              state change. The “old arrays” would update to have the same\n              contents as the “new arrays”. This pointed me towards the source\n              of the problem, and taught me a valuable lesson about object\n              identity in JavaScript.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hor-center\">\n          <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n            <header>Conclusion</header>\n            <article>\n              Fishhook was my first full-stack project at App Academy, and my\n              first real venture into software development. It’s important to\n              note that this project served as an educational experience for me.\n              Not everything about the app is production quality, and there are\n              still plenty of aspects for me to improve upon.\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              I plan to continue to work on Fishhook to improve the user\n              interface, make the layout more responsive to different device\n              sizes, and add the rest of the functionality that I included in\n              the blueprints. All things considered, Fishhook turned out to be\n              an excellent learning experience, and gave me a strong sense of\n              the fundamentals of web development.\n            </article>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Fishhook;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
