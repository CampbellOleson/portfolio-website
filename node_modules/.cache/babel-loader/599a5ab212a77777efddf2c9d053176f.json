I noticed an abundance of fishing-themed Facebook\n            groups, and I myself am an avid fly-fisher, so for my project I\n            decided to create a social media platform specifically designed for\n            people who love to fish (and post about it online).\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <header>Planning</header>\n          <article>\n            When I set out to design and architect Fishhook, I began by\n            determining the core functionality that it would need to include.\n            Fishhook would have to provide a way for users to find and connect\n            with one another. Furthermore, Fishhook users would need to be able\n            to personalize their account and post content for their friends to\n            see. It sounded simple in the early stages, but as I delved further\n            into it, I determined that my app would need user entities with\n            associated post entities, a friend requests system, a search\n            component, profile page components, feed components, and much more.\n          </article>\n\n          <article>\n            Before I started writing any code, I sketched out the backend\n            architecture of my app, as well as all the frontend views that it\n            would include. App Academy gave me a stringent time limit for the\n            completion of this assignment, so after my pen-and-paper wireframes\n            were complete, I began developing.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <header>Features and Functionality</header>\n          <article>\n            I implemented Fishhook using Ruby on Rails for the backend and\n            PostgreSQL for the database. This way, I could leverage Rails’s\n            convention-over-configuration philosophy for quick development, and\n            SQL to manage relationships between different entities in my\n            database, such as users, friend requests, and posts. I used Postman\n            to test my backend API before moving on.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            On the frontend, I leveraged Redux to manage application state, and\n            ReactJS to create a responsive user interface. I employed AJAX to\n            send asynchronous requests to my backend API.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            Users of Fishhook can search other users and friend-request them. If\n            you want to friend-request a user, you can do so by navigating to\n            their profile page and clicking the “Add Friend” button. Incoming\n            friend requests can be viewed in a dropdown modal. You can accept an\n            incoming friend request, or delete it.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-img-small-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img src={Search} alt=\"Search Screenshot\" className=\"cs-img-small\" />\n          <img\n            src={Requests}\n            alt=\"Requests Modal Screenshot\"\n            className=\"cs-img-small\"\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <article className=\"cs-bmo\">\n            Once you’ve befriended a user, you can see their posts in the “Feed”\n            component of the app. You can also navigate to a user’s profile page\n            and see all the content that they have posted. Similarly, you can\n            view a user’s friends on their profile page by clicking on the\n            “Friends” tab.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-img-small-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img\n            src={UserFeed}\n            alt=\"User Feed Screenshot\"\n            className=\"cs-img-small\"\n          />\n          <img\n            src={Friends}\n            alt=\"Friends Screenshot\"\n            className=\"cs-img-small\"\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n        <img src={Feed} alt=\"Feed Screenshot\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <header>Challenges</header>\n          <article>\n            Developing Fishhook presented me with a variety of challenges as a\n            new developer. The first problem I ran into was how to create\n            “friend-requests” between users, that, when accepted, would\n            associate the users and allow them to see each other's content.\n          </article>\n          <article className=\"cs-bmo\">\n            I got around this by creating a “requests” joins table using Ruby on\n            Rails ORM. The table had columns for the “requester_id”, the\n            “requested_id”, and a boolean status field indicating whether or not\n            the request had been accepted. Users create entries in this table\n            when they issue a friend request. Once the receiving user accepts\n            the request, the status field is updated, and the entry becomes an\n            association between the users.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-img-small-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img src={Create} alt=\"Create snippet\" className=\"cs-img-small\" />\n          <img src={Update} alt=\"Update snippet\" className=\"cs-img-small\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <article>\n            I also ran into difficult bugs in this project, the most frustrating\n            of which was an error in one of my Redux reducers. I had a\n            JavaScript Object storing arrays. When I tried to copy this object\n            into the updated application state, I used Object.assign(), which\n            created a shallow copy, and preserved the object ids of the arrays\n            inside.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            I spent hours searching for the cause of the unexpected behavior\n            that ensued. Finally, when logging my application state changes with\n            Chrome DevTools, I noticed that the contents of the arrays from\n            previous state changes retroactively updated with each new state\n            change. The “old arrays” would update to have the same contents as\n            the “new arrays”. This pointed me towards the source of the problem,\n            and taught me a valuable lesson about object identity in JavaScript.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <header>Conclusion</header>\n          <article>\n            Fishhook was my first full-stack project at App Academy, and my\n            first real venture into software development. It’s important to note\n            that this project served as an educational experience for me. Not\n            everything about the app is production quality, and there are still\n            plenty of aspects for me to improve upon.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            I plan to continue to work on Fishhook to improve the user\n            interface, make the layout more responsive to different device\n            sizes, and add the rest of the functionality that I included in the\n            blueprints. All things considered, Fishhook turned out to be an\n            excellent learning experience, and gave me a strong sense of the\n            fundamentals of web development.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Fishhook;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
