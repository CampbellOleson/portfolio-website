I worked on this project with two other\n            students from my cohort. Like myself, one of my teammates was a\n            musician, so we figured that a music streaming service was the\n            perfect project to take on.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <header>Planning</header>\n          <article>\n            Before we began development, my team and I laid out our vision for\n            AmpCamp. We determined that AmpCamp should provide listeners with an\n            easy way to discover new music. We also wanted our website to cater\n            to burgeoning musicians, so we chose to integrate a user-friendly\n            way to upload albums.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            We decided that our AmpCamp’s core features would include a home\n            page for discovering music, an artist profile page, an album show\n            page, an album upload page, and a search feature for finding\n            artists, albums, and songs.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            Before we started writing code, my team and I laid out the\n            architecture for the backend API and application state of our\n            website. Finally, we created wireframe prototypes for the frontend\n            views that our app would include.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            As with my other projects, my team and I used GitHub to manage\n            version control. Before anyone merged a branch, we would come\n            together and test the new feature to make sure that it integrated\n            seamlessly with everything else. I also set up a Trello board to\n            help my team divide and organize responsibilities for this project.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <header>Features and Functionality</header>\n          <article>\n            We built AmpCamp with NodeJS on the backend and MongoDB as the\n            database. We chose MongoDB because we knew that most of our data\n            would be non-relational, and we wanted to get started with minimal\n            setup.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            On the frontend, we leveraged ReactJS for the user interface and\n            Apollo GraphQL to send requests to our backend API. We also\n            integrated Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket for hosting photos and\n            audio files.\n          </article>\n          <article className=\"cs-bmo\">\n            The homepage of AmpCamp enables users to discover new music via\n            “AmpCamp Daily Picks”, which is a scrolling banner list of album\n            recommendations. On the homepage, users can also search for artists,\n            albums, and songs. When you mouseover an album on the homepage, a\n            play pause button appears and allows you to start listening to the\n            album.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin cs-tpf cs-tmo\">\n        <img src={Search} alt=\"AmpCamp Home Page\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <article className=\"cs-bmo\">\n            On an artist’s profile page, you can view all of the albums and\n            songs that an artist has released.

Users listen to songs by clicking on song index items in the\n            list. When listening to a particular song, you can see the song\n            name, artist name, and album cover art displayed on the audio\n            playbar at the bottom of the screen.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin cs-tpf cs-tmo cs-bmo\">\n        <img src={Profile} alt=\"AmpCamp profile page\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin cs-tpf cs-tmo\">\n        <img src={AlbumShow} alt=\"AmpCamp show page\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <article className=\"cs-bmo\">\n            I designed a responsive album-upload interface leveraging ReactJS\n            that constructs an “album preview” in real time using the album\n            information entered by the user.

Occasionally, albums\n            would fail to upload to AWS S3 Bucket part of the way through,\n            leaving the artist with a semi-uploaded album.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            I improved the user experience of this feature by making it so the\n            competent waits until the entire album had been uploaded to S3\n            before redirecting to the artists show page. If the upload fails,\n            the artist will get a user-friendly error message prompting them to\n            try their upload again in a moment. The upload-upload component also\n            keeps its local state even when an upload fails, so artists don’t\n            have to reconstruct the album with every upload attempt.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img\n            src={UploadError}\n            alt=\"Requests Modal Screenshot\"\n            className=\"cs-img-medium\"\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <header>Outcome</header>\n          <article>\n            Building AmpCamp was an incredible learning experience.
