I worked on this project with two other\n            students from my cohort. Like myself, one of my teammates was a\n            musician, so we figured that a music streaming service was the\n            perfect project to take on.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <header>Planning</header>\n          <article>\n            In AmpCamp, my team tried to emulate the core functionality of band\n            camp.

We\n            determined that artists should have profile pages where all their\n            albums and songs could be viewed and listened to. This meant that we\n            also had to integrate audio-player functionality into our app.\n          </article>\n          <article>\n            As with my other projects, my team and I used GitHub to manage\n            version control. Before anyone merged a branch, we would come\n            together and test the new feature to make sure that it integrated\n            seamlessly with everything else. I also set up a Trello board to\n            help my team divide and organize responsibilities for this project.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <header>Features and Functionality</header>\n          <article>\n            AmpCamp was implemented with NodeJS and MongoDB on the backend.

You can stream music on an artists profile page, and a fixed\n            music-player nav bar on the bottom of the page will display the name\n            of the song that’s playing, the album artwork, and the artist that\n            the song belongs to.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin cs-tpf cs-tmo cs-bmo\">\n        <img src={Profile} alt=\"AmpCamp Home Page\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin cs-tpf cs-tmo\">\n        <img src={AlbumShow} alt=\"AmpCamp Home Page\" className=\"cs-img\" />\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock cs-bmo\">\n          <article className=\"cs-bmo\">\n            I was responsible for creating the upload functionality of AmpCamp.\n            If you sign up to AmpCamp as an artist, you can upload as many songs\n            as you want as an album, complete with a description and a cover\n            art.

Occasionally, albums\n            would fail to upload to S3 part of the way through, leaving the\n            artist with a semi-uploaded album. The way I got around this was to\n            have the app stay on the upload page until the upload was complete,\n            afterwhich, it would redirect to the new album show page. If the\n            upload failed, the local state of the upload page would be preserved\n            (so the user didn’t have to recreate the album) and a user-friendly\n            error message would prompt the user to “try again in a moment”. This\n            taught me the importance of good error handling as it pertains to\n            user experience.\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-img-wrapper cs-img-margin\">\n          <img\n            src={UploadError}\n            alt=\"Requests Modal Screenshot\"\n            className=\"cs-img\"\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"hor-center\">\n        <div className=\"cs-textblock\">\n          <header>Conclusion</header>\n          <article>\n            The result of our work was a fully functional indie streaming site,\n            with upload and download functionality.
