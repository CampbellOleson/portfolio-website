          Hi, Iâ€™m Campbell, a full-stack web developer from Salt Lake City,
          Utah. I express my unequivocal love for building things by creating
          websites that are intuitive, dynamic, and responsive.

                I began my career at the University of Utah. I was an
                enthusiastic student, and I was part of the honors-level
                Business Scholars program, but I was ultimately unsatisfied with
                the pace of business school. While studying, I got an internship
                doing product and QA work at Canopy, Inc. where I discovered my
                passion for software development.

                Determined to delve deeper into software development, I found
                App Academy: a highly-rated web development bootcamp with a 3%
                acceptance rate. After an immersive, 6-month course filled with
                group projects and hands-on practice, I graduated with a
                versatile skill set in full-stack web development.

                Since graduating from App Academy, I have been refining my
                skills by building my own websites, and adding to my toolset by
                taking courses on Pluralsight. I am determined to keep learning
                and I am eager for an opportunity to prove myself in the tech
                industry. I am excited to see where my endeavors will take me

          My current toolset includes Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, PostgreSQL,
          ReactJS, Redux, Apollo GraphQL, and MongoDB. I have integrated
          external APIs into my projects, including Open Weather API and Google
          Maps API. I also have experience with leveraging AWS S3 Bucket for
          uploading and hosting photos and audio files.

          Recently, I have been educating myself on Python, Java, networking,
          and application security. I have a strong fundamental knowledge of

          continue learning skills as a way to indulge my endless curiosity, and
          I'm confident in my ability to quickly get up to speed with new
          technologies.
