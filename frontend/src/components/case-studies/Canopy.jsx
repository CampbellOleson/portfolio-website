              I worked with product and QA at Canopy, Inc. to create Tax Prep: a
              workflow management software for tax practitioners. The main
              purpose of Tax Prep is to streamline the tax preparation process
              by automatically filling out tax forms.

            At Canopy, we set out to build a revolutionary tax prep software
            that was miles ahead of its competitors, both in utility and design.
            My role on this project was to write reference logic to autocomplete
            tax forms, and to manually QA the end-user product.

            My primary contribution to Tax Prep was the creation of software
            logic that automatically filled out tax forms based on end-user
            input. I would read and interpret tax-form instructions, and then
            translate them into programs that our software environment would
            execute to fill out the form.

            The IRS laid out rules for e-Filing tax returns in an XSD schema, so
            a lot of my QA work involved making sure that the software logic
            that we wrote returned data that was compatible with the schema. The
            most common mistakes I would correct were invalid data types,
            invalid numbers of decimal places, incorrect calculations in the
            logic, and dollar amounts that were outside the range permitted by
            the IRS.

            I would also manually fill out tax scenarios in the end-user
            product, and then make sure that all the related tax forms were
            filled out correctly with respect to my input. Following this, I
            would e-File the scenario, and read over the XML response from the
            IRS to check for errors. Typically, there were errors, and I would
            track them down in our logic and correct them.

            Working on Tax Prep provided me with a variety of challenges. It was
            the first exposure I had to any sort of software development. The
            most challenging aspect of the job was reading and interpreting tax
            instructions and translating them into software logic with complete
            fidelity and precision.

            While working on Tax Prep, I learned a lot about software
            development, and often times I didn't have anyone to walk me through
            the process. This taught me to take the initiative to educate myself
            when I came across a term or technology that I didnâ€™t understand.

            The result of my work, and the work of the rest of the product and
            QA teams, was a highly-sophisticated tax-prep software that could
            automatically fill out and file hundreds of tax documents, and prove
            invaluable to tax professionals who used it. Tax prep was part of a
            larger integrated software suite to help tax practitioners
            streamline and automate their workload. It was an incredible
            product, and I was proud to be part of the team.

            I had the opportunity to take part in the development of an
            innovative software product. I also learned a lot about QA and the
            software development lifecycle. Furthermore, Tax Prep received a lot
            of attention and positive press during the time I worked with
            Canopy. My time with Canopy was a formative, career-shaping
            experience.
