              I created a map-based surf locator website that allows users to
              find information on surf spots. RipCamp’s main purpose is to
              provide users with an intuitive, easy-to-use way to discover and
              explore new surf spots around the globe.

            During my software development course with App Academy, I was put in
            a team with two other students, and tasked with creating a
            full-stack web application. The purpose and implementation details
            of the website were up to us. My teammates and I were all surfing
            enthusiasts, so we came up with the idea of RipCamp: a one-stop-shop
            for planning your day of surfing.

            Before we started architecting and designing RipCamp, we discussed
            the functionality that our website would include. We determined that
            the primary interface would consist of a map displaying the spots’
            locations, and a list of quickshow items, allowing users to view
            specific information on each spot. Furthermore, we decided to
            include a search feature so users could locate particular spots.
            Finally, we decided to include a show page for every surf spot,
            displaying photos of the spot, as well as information about weather
            and surf conditions.

            My team and I wanted to make sure that our project stayed organized,
            so we used GitHub to manage version control. Before anyone merged a
            branch, we would come together and test the new feature to make sure
            that it integrated seamlessly with everything else. I also set up a
            Trello board to help my team divide and organize responsibilities
            for this project.

            We built RipCamp with NodeJS on the backend and MongoDB as the
            database. We chose MongoDB so we could easily store lots of
            unrelated records with minimal setup.

            We leveraged Redux to manage application state, and designed a
            responsive user interface with ReactJS. We also integrated Google
            Maps API for the map-based interface, Open Weather API for weather
            information, and AWS S3 Bucket for photo hosting.

            On the left hand side of RipCamp’s primary interface is the surf
            spots-index, complete with quickshow items that have names,
            descriptions, and scrolling photos. On the right hand side is the
            map, with surf-green pointers for the geographical location of each
            surf spot. The surf-spots index only displays the spots that are
            currently shown on the map. If you move the map around, the index
            will be updated in real time to display the surf spots that are
            within the map’s bounds.

            I used JavaScript DOM manipulation to give this interface some
            eye-catching UI effects. If you hover your mouse over a surf spot on
            the map, the surf-spots index will automatically scroll to and
            highlight the corresponding quickshow item! This makes for smooth
            navigation and easy discovery of new surf spots.

            When a user clicks on a surf-spot quickshow item from the surf-spots

            Users can search for a surf spot by name and find its show page, as
            well as its location on the map. Similarly, users can apply
            location-based filters to the search, which will recenter the map on
            the city that they choose.

            The biggest development challenge on RipCamp was figuring how to
            query the database and update the application state in such a way
            that the surf-spots index always displays the surf spots on the map.

            The first few approaches to this problem that I came up with were
            roundabout and impractical, but I knew that there had to be a
            straightforward solution. Then, while looking through the docs of
            Google Maps API I realized that the Map object provides the
            latitude/longitude coordinates of each corner of the map. Using the
            northeast and southwest corners, I wrote a query to return all of
            the spots with coordinates within these ranges.

            Once I had my API serving up surf spots based on the map’s
            boundaries, I wrote Redux actions to modify my application state
            each time a new batch of surf spots comes in. After every “map rest”
            event (which is fired when you stop moving the map around), the
            application state clears out the surf spots that were previously
            displayed. Then, the frontend client requests more surf spots from
            my API, passing over the new bounds. Finally, the application state
            and frontend components are updated with the new data.

            I ran into a few quirks with my boundaries-based query system. For
            example, if the map was centered over the prime meridian, the query
            wouldn’t return any surf spots, because the underlying logic would
            look for spots greater than the westmost longitude (somewhere around
            +180°) and less than the eastmost longitude (somewhere around
            -180°). Fortunately, there are no surf spots on the prime meridian,
            and I realized that by slightly zooming the map window I could
            ensure that the prime meridian is never on the map while a surf spot
            is on the map. This prevents the prime meridian from breaking my
            query and goes to show that sometimes complicated problems have
            simple solutions.

            The result of our work was a beautifully designed application with a
            responsive user interface, and a nuanced query system that
            integrated seamlessly with the architecture of our application
            state. These features culminated to empower users with an intuitive
            new way of discovering surf spots.

            Furthermore, this project was an invaluable learning experience for
            me. It taught me how to work with Google Maps API, how to design
            more responsive and visually interesting user interfaces, and how to
            engineer sophisticated systems for managing application state.
