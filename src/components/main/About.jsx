          that are responsive, dynamic, and user friendly. My current toolset
          includes React, Redux, Apollo GraphQL, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS,
          PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

                My career began in the Business Scholars program at the
                University of Utah. There, I was connected with an internship at
                Canopy, Inc. where I worked for four months and discovered my
                passion for software development.

                In searching for the fastest way to learn web development I came
                upon App Academy: a demanding, 6-month immersive bootcamp with a
                3% acceptance rate. I was accepted in, and graduated from App
                Academy in October of 2019.

                I have since been working on solo projects and adding to my
                toolset by taking courses on Pluralsight. I am determined to
                always keep learning, and find an opportunity to prove myself in
                the industry. I am a junior, but I am hungry, and I'm excited to
                see where I go next!
